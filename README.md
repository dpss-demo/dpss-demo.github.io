# Distribution Preserving Source Separation with Time Frequency Predictive Models

This is the demonstration page of the paper "Distribution Preserving Source Separation with Time Frequency Predictive Models" with the samples used for the MUSHRA-style listening test.

## Info

### Abstract

We provide an example of a distribution preserving source separation method, which aims at addressing perceptual shortcomings of state-of-the-art methods. Our approach uses unconditioned generative models of signal sources. Reconstruction is achieved by means of mix-consistent sampling from a distribution conditioned on a realization of a mix. The separated signals follow their respective source distributions, which provides an advantage when separation results are evaluated in a listening test.
